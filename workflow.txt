Flat Terrain Preparation
==================================
1. Prepare SP structure for flat terrain calculation (sp.flat_calculate ='XX.sav', sp.flat_flux_file='', slope = 0)
2. Run preprocess_thermal_model.pro as before. File sp.run_number+'_preprocessed.sav' is created.
	->No surface scattering included (obviously)
	->Simple atmospheric radiation added to SWF and LWF

**** Need to intervene here ****
Read sp.run_number+'_preprocessed.sav'
Change LWF and SWF to MCD+DISORT values  

!!!!!!!!!!!!!! What does one use for surface temperature and albedo? !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
This probably requires iteration... 

Change sp.run_number to be 'DISORT_'+sp.run_number
Change sp.flat_calculate to be 'DISORT_'+sp.flat_calculate
Write 'DISORT_'+sp.run_number+'_preprocessed_MCD.sav'


3. Run thermal_model_v07.pro as before. 
Use sp.run_number+'_preprocessed.sav'. Two files are created [sp.run_number+'_results.sav' and sp.flat_calculate]
Use 'DISORT_'+sp.run_number+'_preprocessed.sav'. Two files are created ['DISORT_'+sp.run_number+'_results.sav' and 'DISORT_'+sp.flat_calculate]



Sloping Terrain Run
==================================

1. Prepare SP structure for sloping terrain calculation (sp.flat_calculate ='', sp.flat_flux_file = 'XX.sav', slope =/= 0)
	This is still the pre-disort approach... it's ok since we'll swap out atm and surface scattered radiation in the next step

2. Run preprocess_thermal_model.pro as before. File sp.run_number+'_preprocessed.sav' is created.
	-> Surface scattering will be added based on non-disort results from above 
	-> Simple atmospheric radiation added to SWF and LWF

**** Need to intervene here ****
Read sp.run_number+'_preprocessed.sav'
Read MCO2 and TSURF results from the flat surface DISORT_??_results.sav file. Use these to calculate the LWF and SWF on the scarp.
Change LWF and SWF to MCD+DISORT values. Includes direct, atm, and surface scattering.
Change sp.run_number to be 'DISORT_'+sp.run_number
Write 'DISORT_'+sp.run_number+'_preprocessed_MCD.sav'

No iteration is required here because the temperature or albedo of the scarp doesn't affect the atmosphere.

3.  Run thermal_model_v07.pro for the adjusted and original preprocessed file



Simplified
==================================
Make parameter files as before

Preprocess the flat run
Get the flat thermal results
Iterate on the flat run using temperatures and mco2 values to adjust the atmosphere.

Preprocess the slope run
Create a new preprocessing file using the DISORT-adjusted flat results
Get the slope thermal results for the original approximations and the DISORT-adjusted results

Get the stress results for the original and adjusted slope temperatures.



Next Steps
==================================
Validate MCD scattering results
Generate scattering results for all Ls

Temps and MCO2 are in IDL save files...
